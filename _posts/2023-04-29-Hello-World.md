title: Hello World!
---

Hey!

I guess, for a computer science student Hello World is the most apt first post. So shall it be. I've had blogs before, but this one is primarily aimed towards being a documentation for the things I do in cybersecurity. But don't be surprised if you see a couple of tangents and ramblings about different topics too. Yup. That's about it. Enjoy
