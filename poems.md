### The Last Vine

{% highlight text %}
I open my eyes as slowly as I can,
Never liked to see the reality.
But there are times when you have to 
Wipe your mind, for clarity.

My feet are stuck to the ground
So comfortably still.
The world to me is a blur
Pacing away, full of will.

And then I decide, its time
I'm just tired of being stuck,
I try so hard to lift my feet
but its just so deep in this pointless muck.

I call out to the others, as hard as I can
At the top of my lungs I scream
Never expected even one to care
But they do , just like its a dream.

They try to lift me up, to pull me out
But suddenly somehow I dont want to.
I realize I've grown attached to
this addiction, not letting me chase you.

You, my angel, whisper to me
It's time for you to fly.
I reply back, but I don't want to
But we both know that's a lie.

I blink my eyes and I'm stunned,
Not staying still anymore.
I'm just falling down, the high cliff
Paralysed to the very core.

And you throw me down, a long vine
As always trying to save me.
And I know I have to catch it
As I'm falling down to the sea.

I stretch my hands to the vine,
the last vine I'll ever get
My eyes are quivering with panic
And yours are just a little wet.

The roaring sea below me
Calling out to me, to a mindless end
But I don't want to go , I don't want to get lost
And so my fingers reach out to the vine

To the last vine, to the last hope, fluttering in the wind.

### Grief

It fills up inside you
to the edge of your throat
You can feel the cracks it makes
on your soul
Your breath gets heavy
Your mind fogs up
The strong shaky grip
Of a long-buried grief
Is this the only way to live,
Alongside this war-torn neighbor?

വേദനകളെ ഉറക്കിയവരല്ലേ നമ്മൾ ?
